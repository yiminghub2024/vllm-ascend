"""Sparse MLA attention for the GLM-5.3-Flash kpool indexer.

GLM-5.3-Flash is NoPE MLA plus KDA, and its sparse layers attend to a subset of
the past chosen by a *pooled* indexer: groups of ``index_kpool`` consecutive
index keys compress to one cached vector, so both the index cache and the
scoring cost shrink by that factor.

This builds on ``AscendMLAImpl`` rather than ``AscendSFAImpl``. DeepSeek's
sparse impl assumes rope-ful MLA over a two-tensor main cache, while every
layer here has ``qk_rope_head_dim == 0``, which is also the configuration the
dense GLM path already runs correctly.

Per sparse layer the chain is: project the indexer key, its pooling gate and
its query; compress into the pooled key cache and the tail ring; score the
pools and expand the winners into token ids; attend over just those tokens.

Where the metadata comes from, since three cache groups are involved:

============================================  ==============================
``attn_metadata``                             block table, sequence lengths,
                                              token positions, the shared
                                              zero rope buffers
``attn_metadata[k_cache.prefix]``             pool-granular slot mapping
``attn_metadata[tail_cache.prefix]``          tail ring slot mapping
============================================  ==============================

One deliberate limit of this first implementation:

* The indexer query re-runs the q-lora projection instead of reusing the one
  the MLA preprocess already computed, which costs one extra GEMM per sparse
  layer. The preprocess does not hand ``q_c`` back and it is shared with the
  models that have no indexer, so threading it out is left for later.
