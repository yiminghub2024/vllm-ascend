"""Index-K and tail cache writes for the GLM-5.3-Flash kpool indexer.

The indexer scores pools, not tokens: every ``pool_size`` consecutive keys
collapse into one cached vector, so ``index_kpool`` times fewer entries are
scored and ``npu_lightning_indexer`` returns pool ids directly. Producing those
entries is what this module does.

Two caches are involved. The index-K cache holds one compressed vector per
*complete* pool and is what the indexer scores against. The tail cache is a
per-request ring of ``pool_size`` slots holding the raw keys and gate scores of
the pool still being filled: that pool cannot be compressed yet, but its tokens
must not be lost, because the pool completes on a later step -- possibly after a
PD transfer. Prefill seeds the ring, decode advances it and compresses each pool
as it completes.

Ascend departs from the CUDA path in one way, and it simplifies everything
downstream: the cached entry stays bf16 instead of being Hadamard-rotated and
quantized to FP8. ``npu_lightning_indexer`` scores bf16 keys, and the rotation
only ever existed to spread energy before quantization -- it is a normalized
orthogonal transform, so ``(Hq).(Hk) == q.k`` and dropping it from both sides
changes nothing. The result is *more* accurate than the FP8 path, at 2 bytes per
dimension per pool.

Nothing here reads a device tensor on the host. Writes that must be skipped --
padded requests, tokens whose pool has not completed -- are aimed at slot 0
instead of being masked out: block 0 is vLLM's reserved null block, which
``BlockPool`` never hands to a request, so those writes land somewhere nothing
reads. That keeps every scatter a plain ``index_copy_`` with in-range indices.
