"""Ascend causal conv1d entry points for the GLM-5.3-Flash KDA layers.

The upstream CUDA kernels reference ``tl.extra.cuda.gdc_wait``, which Ascend
Triton does not provide -- the AST visitor raises even when ``launch_pdl`` is
False. Both entry points are therefore routed to Ascend implementations.

The decode/draft-verify update has to stay free of host syncs: reading a device
tensor with ``.item()`` is rejected outright while an ACL graph is being
captured, so a single such read aborts decode-FULL capture. It also has to stay
free of per-request Python loops, because it runs once per KDA layer on every
decode step. Two implementations satisfy that, picked by hardware:

* ``npu_causal_conv1d_custom``, the fused operator the Qwen3-Next GDN and Kimi
  KDA layers already use. It is unavailable wherever ``enable_custom_op()`` is
  off, which currently includes A5 -- its hardware profile withholds
  ``RUNTIME_CUSTOM_OPS`` (see vllm-ascend issue #7157).
* A batched torch expression, below, that folds the whole batch into a handful
  of elementwise kernels.

The varlen (prefill) path keeps the per-request PyTorch implementation: its
lengths are genuinely ragged and prefill is never graph-captured.

Both entry points take ``x`` token-major (``[num_tokens, dim]``), ``weight`` in
the fused operator's ``[width, dim]`` kernel layout, and ``conv_state`` exactly
as the Mamba cache allocates it.
