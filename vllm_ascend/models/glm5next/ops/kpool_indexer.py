"""Pool scoring and selection for the GLM-5.3-Flash kpool indexer on Ascend.

``npu_lightning_indexer`` scores a paged key cache and returns the ids of the
highest-scoring entries. Because the GLM index cache holds one entry per pool of
``index_kpool`` tokens, those ids are pool ids, and the sparse attention needs
token ids -- so selection is scoring plus an expansion.

Two properties of the operator shape everything here, both established by
probing an Ascend 950:

* It takes one key length per *request*, and its ``sparse_mode=3`` mask moves
  the boundary by one key per query row. With pooled keys a key is
  ``index_kpool`` tokens, so that boundary advances four times too fast. Asking
  for a key length per query row is rejected outright (error 561002).
* ``sparse_mode=0`` applies no mask at all and matches an unmasked reference.

So selection runs unmasked over the pool prefix that is causally valid for
*every* query row of the request, and the expansion names the remaining recent
tokens explicitly. That is exact -- nothing is dropped and no future token is
named -- and it covers a draft-verify batch, whose rows sit at different
positions, for the same reason it covers a prefill chunk.
